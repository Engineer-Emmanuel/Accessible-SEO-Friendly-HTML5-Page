Accessible & SEO-Friendly HTML5 Web Page
This project is a basic HTML5 webpage created to demonstrate best practices in web accessibility and SEO (Search Engine Optimization) using semantic and clean HTML markup.

Project Overview
The page is designed with the goal of being both user-friendly and search engine friendly by using:

Proper semantic HTML5 elements that provide meaningful structure to the content.

Accessibility features such as ARIA attributes and well-organized headings to help users with disabilities navigate easily.

Basic SEO optimizations including descriptive titles, meta descriptions, and keyword-rich content.

Key Features
Semantic Structure:
Utilizes HTML5 tags like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, and <footer> for clear, logical content organization.

Accessibility:

Landmarks (<nav>, <main>) provide assistive technologies with navigation cues.

Headings (h1 through h3) follow a logical order to facilitate screen reader comprehension.

ARIA attributes such as aria-label and aria-labelledby enhance usability for users relying on assistive devices.

SEO Best Practices:

Well-crafted <title> and <meta name="description"> elements for better search engine visibility.

Clear, human-readable, and keyword-rich content that improves crawling and indexing.

A logical heading hierarchy that supports search engine understanding.

Usage
Open the HTML file in any modern browser to view the page.

Use the navigation links to jump to different sections: About, Key Features, and Contact.

Review the code to learn how semantic tags and ARIA roles can improve accessibility and SEO.

Notes
Contact Links:
The current email and phone links are plain URLs. It is recommended to update them using proper schemes for usability:

xml
<a href="mailto:emmanuelonyango955@gmail.com">message</a>
<a href="tel:0700495115">call</a>
This page focuses on HTML only; styling and scripting can be added to enhance visual presentation and interactivity.
